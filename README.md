## Abstract 
Objective: Cellular heterogeneity of human adipose tissue is linked to the pathophysiology of obesity and may impact the response to energy restriction and changes in fat mass. Here, we provide an optimized pipeline to estimate cellular composition in human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) bulk RNA-seq datasets using single-nuclei (sn)RNA-seq signature matrix. 

Methods: A deconvolution pipeline for ASAT was optimized by benchmarking publicly available algorithms using a signature matrix derived from ASAT snRNA-Seq data from 20 adults, then applied to estimate ASAT cell-type proportions in publicly available obesity and weight loss studies. 

Results: Individuals with obesity had greater proportions of macrophages and lower proportions of adipocyte sub-populations and vascular cells compared with lean individuals. Two months of diet-induced weight loss increased the estimated proportions of macrophages; however, two years of DIWL reduced the estimated proportions of macrophages, thereby suggesting a bi-phasic nature of cellular remodeling of ASAT during weight loss. 

Conclusion: Our optimized high-throughput pipeline facilitates the assessment of composition changes of highly characterized cell types in large numbers of ASAT samples using low-cost bulk RNA-Seq. Our data reveal novel changes in cellular heterogeneity and its association with cardiometabolic health in humans with obesity and following weight loss.
