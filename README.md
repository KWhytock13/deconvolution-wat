## SUMMARY 

Cellular heterogeneity in adipose tissue, where more than half of the cells are non-adipocytes, is implicated linkedin to the pathophysiology of obesity. Here, we provide an pipeline optimized pipeline to estimate cellular composition in human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) from bulk RNA-Sseq using signature profiles from full-length snRNA-Seq. Individuals with Oobesity compared towith  lean had greater proportions of macrophages and lower proportions of different adipocytes sub-populations and vascular cells. The optimized pipeline estimated higher proportions of macrophages and lower proportions of adipocytes and vascular cells in individuals with obesity compared with lean. Importantly, metabolically healthy individuals with obesity were estimated to have lower proportions of macrophages and vascular cells, and higher proportion of insulin-responsive adipocytes compared with a well-matched metabolically unhealthy group. Additionally, while the estimated proportion of macrophages was reduced by years of diet-induced weight loss (DIWL), it was estimated to increase by two-month of DIWL, suggesting a bi-phasic nature of cellular remodeling of ASAT during weight loss. Our optimized high-throughput pipeline allows researchers to assessassessment of cell composition changes of highly characterized cell types in large quantities of ASAT samples using low-cost bulk RNA-Seq and reveals novel changes in cellular heterogeneity and its association with cardiometabolic health.
